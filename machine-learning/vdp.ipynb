    "## Collinearity\n",
    "\n",
    "Collinearity has eluded definition, and has been colloquially referred to as as _multicollinearity and ill-conditioning_. For a given set of numerical data in a dataset (referred to as the matrix/data-matrix from here on), we can say k of the variates (so k of the **columns** in this dataset) are collinear if the vectors that represent them lie in a subspace of dimension less than $k$; i.e. if one of the columns is a linear combination of one or more of the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Johnston et. al.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11135-017-0584-6) give qualitative descriptions/conditions-to-be-met for collinearity:\n",
    "- When the variables concerned are control variables in a regression model, whose coefficients are not to be interpreted, but the variables of interest do not display collinearity, either among themselves or with the control variables \n",
    "- One or more of the variables is a power of another variable included in the regression for example, some regressions include both age and age2 as variables, and these are almost certain to be collinear\n",
    "- The variables concerned are dummy variables representing variables with three or more\n",
    "categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note that while I agree with what they are attempting to describe, their focus on the model as opposed to the data is less than appealing*\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world scenarios, this perfect collinearity rarely occurs, so a broader notion is needed (see  [Belsley et. al](https://www.amazon.com/Regression-Diagnostics-Identifying-Influential-Collinearity/dp/0471691178)). A more expansive description of collinearity is when the angle between the vectors reperented by two (or more) of the variates (columns) is relatively small. The idea is that we have unobserved (latent) variables that may be directly related to two or more of our variates, and may be due to either the nature of the data (e.g. the wingspan and length of an aircraft are collinear with weight most of the times) OR the number of data is low. This second type of collinearity occurs because not all combinations of environmental conditions exist in the study area or when very many variables are involved (see [Dormann et. al.](https://www.biom.uni-freiburg.de/Dateien/PDF/dormann2012ecography_proofprints.pdf))\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point it is of note that collinearity is inherently a **data** problem, NOT A MODEL PROBLEM. The most obvious issue with collinearity is that having one variate which is essentially a scaled version of another provides no new information, leading to a difficulty in separating the influence of collinear explanatory variables on a given target. Now that we've established collinearity as a data problem, we can further extend the issue to instability of the linear least-squares predictors. When we have collinear data, the net effect is of predictor instability, which can lead to spurious coefficients and little to no explainability.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Historical Ways to Investigate Collinearity\n",
    "Historically, there have been several ways of addressing collinearity:\n",
    "1. Hypothesis testing\n",
    "This uses typically a $t$ test for explanatory variables, and is often cited as evidence of collinearity when the test statistic is low. However, according to [Belsley et. al.], this hypothesis test is neither necessary nor sufficient for detecting collinearity, and further does not assess the degree of collinearity present\n",
    "2. Correlation Matrix\n",
    "The correlation matrix of a data matrix is typically taken as $\\bold{X^TX}$, if the data matrix is centered and scaled to unit length. The absence of high correlations cannot be viewed as evidence of no problem (for example three or more variates collinear with no two variates alone highly correlated, which the correlation matrix is incapable of diagnosing). Additionally the correlation matrix cannot diagnose several coexisting near dependencies (e.g. if we have high correlations between a and b, and c and d, we cannot tell whether there's some underlying common dependency).\n",
    "3. The determinant of the correlation matrix \n",
    "[Farrar and Glauber](https://www.scirp.org/(S(lz5mqp453edsnp55rrgjct55))/reference/referencespapers.aspx?referenceid=2468723) assumed that an $n\\times p$ matrix with orthogonal columns, the data $\\bold{X}$ is a sample from a $p$-variate Gaussian distribution. Their proposed measure is the partial correlation between $\\bold{X}_i$ and $\\bold{X}_j$, adjusted for all other variates. According to Belsley et. al, using the determinant of the correlation matrix (which is essentially what Farrar and Glauber use) frequently indicates collinearity when no problem exists. The final criticism comes from [Kumar](https://ideas.repec.org/a/tpr/restat/v57y1975i3p365-66.html), where the assumption that our data matrix can be modeled as a stochastic, i.i.d. matrix is hardly ever satisfied.\n",
    "4. VIF \n",
    "The weakness of VIF (like using $\\bold{R}$) comes down to its inability to distinguish among several coexisting near dependencies, and a lack of clear definition of what a high or unacceptable VIF is. Furthermore, if using VIF, the degree of collinearity indicated by the VIF is not agreed upon, and the \"best-practices\" thresholds have not converged over the years\n",
    "*For reference, the diagonal elements of $\\bold{R}^{-1}$ are called the variance inflation factors, where $\\bold{R}^{-1}=(\\bold{X}^T\\bold{X})^{-1}$.*\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors (or principal components) of the correlation matrix \n",
    "The idea to use \"small\" eigenvalues as an indicator of collinearity is not misfounded. The main issue with this approach is that of finding exactly what \"small\".\n",

    "## Okay, so I have collinearity, now what? \n",
    "Once variates with near dependencies identified, use regression of one variate by the other. The authors recommend that individual regression analyses need be carried out using one of the collinears against the others. This fits with the idea of \"conditioning\" the matrix $X_1$ on $X_2$ and vice versa. This aspect is beyond the scope of this post (and I would prefer to go in-depth into it as opposed to cluttering this with more theory), since the VDP is what really piqued my attention. For further reading, see the references section."
